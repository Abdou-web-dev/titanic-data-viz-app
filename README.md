Titanic Passenger Data Model Application
This application provides a data model for Titanic passenger data, focusing on building an effective and structured SQLAlchemy model using Python and SQLAlchemy ORM for easy database interaction. The model captures key passenger details, including survival status, ticket class, personal information, and more, to be used for analysis, data science, or integration into a larger project.

Features
Passenger Data Modeling: The application defines a SQLAlchemy-based model representing the Titanic passenger dataset, which includes key fields such as:

Survival Status: Whether the passenger survived or not.
Pclass: The passenger's class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
Name: The passenger's full name.
Sex: Gender of the passenger.
Age: Age of the passenger.
Siblings/Spouses Aboard: Number of siblings or spouses traveling with the passenger.
Parents/Children Aboard: Number of parents or children traveling with the passenger.
Fare: The fare paid by the passenger.
Ticket: The ticket number of the passenger.
Cabin: The cabin number the passenger stayed in.
Embarked: The port where the passenger embarked (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).
Flexible and Scalable: The model can be easily extended to support additional passenger attributes or custom business logic.

Database Ready: The model is built for integration with relational databases using SQLAlchemy ORM, providing easy and seamless interaction with your database.
